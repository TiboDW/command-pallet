This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### to open commandpallet pres command-k or ctrl-k.

the commandpallet can be used to navigate through pages.

typescript is used(but i have little to no knowledge on how to use types. So regual javascript expressions were used)

### the stack used in this project:

-nextjs: easy of use (most used metaframework for react)(have little experience with react, only started a month ago)

-tailwindcss (easy of use + works great with nextjs)

-headless ui (components fitted the best for making a commandpallet)


### focus of the project:

Creating the look of the commpand pallet, for back-end data we used a jsonfile.

### difficulties during the project:

Since being a newcomer to react. Working with useState and state management/use effect was a challenge.
